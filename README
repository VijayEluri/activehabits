          ActiveHabits

Thanks for taking a look.  ActiveHabits is an Android application
that saves button clicks, then charts the clicks to provide
visual feedback.

The website is http://www.activehabits.com

My original idea is to track my own personal habits, yet the
application is flexible enough to track any activity
you care about.

I look forward to hearing how people use ActiveHabits.

This implementation could be used in many ways but I will
first be supporting making this code even better for the
original intended use.

I welcome other people exploring other uses.  If you are
interested in seeing features implemented and can provide
some resources please contact me.
