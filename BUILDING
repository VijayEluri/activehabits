The Android Development Kit recommends the use of Eclipse
to develop applications. I have added some files to the
git repository at the top level to support this. After
much effort I am climbing the considerable learning curve
that Eclipse requires for full configuration. It seems
worth the effort for the logging and debugging features
that are rather well integrated, though I still have to
perform workarounds to keep things working making me
believe that these development tools are not fully
tested and debugged.

An alternative way of building the application is from
some commands using the command line as described:
